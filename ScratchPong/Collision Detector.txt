WHATS:
What is the Collision Detector?
This keeps track of all other objects within the game world position.
It detects when and who collides with any other object, and send a message to the 
cooresponding objects so that they may intiate they're cooresponding behavior upon
collision

HOWS:

How will we detect collisions?
We keep track of the position of all objects and continously check their positions to see when they overlap

How will we detect that the ball collide with the walls?
Remember that the ball has 4 walls.
When the the right wall of the ball's x coordinate is >= to the right wall of the screen that it touches, 
then there is a collision.
When the the top wall of the ball's y coordinate is >= to the top wall of the screen that it touches, 
then there is a collision.
When the the bottom wall of the ball's y coordinate is <= to the bottom wall of the screen that it touches, 
then there is a collision.
Then we send a message to the ball of the details of the collision

How will we detect that the ball collides with the paddle?
When the the left wall of the ball's x coordinate is <= to the paddle that it touches, 
then there is a collision.
Then we send a message to the ball of the details of the collision and a message to the
score.

How will we detect that the ball has gone past the paddle?
The ball's left wall goes completely
past the paddle and into the screen's left wall. (Left wall's x is < the screen's left wall x )
Then we send a message to the Restart menu

How will we detect the mouse hovering over menu options?
We keep track of the position of the mouse and see if it overlaps the area of the menu options.
Upon a click and colliding, we send a message to the menu option.
