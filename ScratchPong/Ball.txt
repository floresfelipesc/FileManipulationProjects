WHATS:

What is the ball?
We define the ball a square that bounces around the stage. 
The ball has 4 walls making up the square
It gets faster when bouncing off of the paddle

What does the ball bouncing off of the walls and paddle mean?
Bouncing off of the walls and paddle mean that the ball will reverse and preserve 
one of it's movement vectors. 

What does it mean that the ball gets faster?
This means that whatever movement vector the ball currently has, raise those the numbers in whatever
increment you see fit.




HOWS:
--How will the ball move?
Using movement vectors, we will draw the ball to the screen in different positions
rapidly to give the illusion of movement. For
a full range of movement, the ball will have 4 major movement vectors corresponding to 
it's full range of motion. (+,+) (-,-) (+,-) (-,+) 

--How will the ball start it's movement? 
It will start in the same initial position each time, and be "served".
The ball will always start in the middle in the 
righthand part of the screen. When the game starts, the ball will start to move in a random direction 
towards the paddle. This will be a range of 45 degrees. The ball will never be served at a 0 degree angle

--How do we reverse the ball's movement vectors?
When the ball collides with a vertical wall, y is preserved and x is reverse in sign. When the
ball collides with a horizontal wall, x is preserved and y is reversed in sign.


--How will the ball increase it's speed when colliding with the paddle
The ball will have a speed multiplier to it's own current movement that we will modify to make it go faster
each time

x = 5 

1


How will collision be detected? 
That is up to another object
