--When the Ball bounces off of the paddle, it increases in speed but then slows down after colliding with a wall
Fixed
--When the ball gets too fast, it can phase through the walls of the game as it stands.
Not possible to fix unless I have control over the order in which things run in, which
is not possible in Scratch. Unfortunate.

I would need to calculate where the ball would move before actually moving it. 
If the ball's future move would go past the collision, then we treat it as if it is
colliding.
Then upon colliding we adjust the movement values.

Put all of this as a part of collision detection and run collision first before running movement.
