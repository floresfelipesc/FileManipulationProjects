WHATS:

--What is pong? 
Pong is a classic game where it is the virtual version of tennis. It involves a single ball that collides
and bounces off the walls of the window, and off of the 2 paddles who are 
controlled by our players. The paddles can only move up or down.

--What is a single player version of pong? 
It is a spin on the original Pong. There will be only 1 paddle controller by our single player. Our paddle
will be located gatekeeping the left wall. The ball will collide and bounce off of the other 3 walls
and our paddle. 


--What does it mean that the game keeps track of your highest score?
It means that whatever score you end the game with is compared to the past high score and updated
accordingly.
