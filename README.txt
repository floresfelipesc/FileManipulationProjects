Visual Studio
Windows File System

DESCRIPTION:
This folder contains a collection of Console Apps that I created 
for the purpose of automating repetitive tasks within the
Windows File System that I personally perform often enough to warrant
the need to create these small Console Apps. 

HOW TO USE:
In each Project folder, you will find 2 main folders. 
"App" folders: Are folders that contain the executable files
to run the respective console app
"Source Code" folders: Are folders that contain the source code 
to run the respective console app

Click the green "Code" button and "Download ZIP" to 
whichever ones you desire.

Thanks and have fun!
